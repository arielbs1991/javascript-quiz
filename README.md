# javascript-quiz

In this assignment we had to build a quiz about JavaScript, using Javascript. I created a map with a set of keys and arrays and finicked A LOT to generate spans where I wrote responsive questions to the page. The quiz is times and starts with the click of a button, it tracks user score and penalizes with a time decrement for wrong answers, and it stores user initials and score to local storage. When I revisit this project I would like to add more questions, and also create a screen that alerts the user of their score and can recall their information from local storage.
